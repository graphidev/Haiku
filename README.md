# Haiku project

This is a school project made while a get beyond our limits week. We had as objective to build an interactive representation of an [Haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku). This is the final result of my participation.

## Working process

### The idea

First, we thought the meaning of the haiku. Mine could be translated as "From time to time the clouds let us have some rest from wathing to the moon". My interpretation of this has been : "beeing focus on only one thing prevent us to see what we are looking for".

I then though about something that should be discoverable. The idea of my interactive illustration was born.

### The draw

From this idea above, I decided to build an interactive illustration. I am not a really good drawer, and this was my main interest in the project : experience to draw an entire illustration (You'll find them in the [`Haiku.sketch`](https://github.com/graphidev/Haiku/blob/master/Haiku.sketch) file).

Sketch is now part of my tools set. However, we use to use it as an UI software as well as prototypes. Why not trying to draw more complex forms with my mouse. It turned out that a lot of thing can be done with this software.


### The build

I already participated to an animating SVG competition. I haven't been really good that time. This was the moment to prove myself I'm able to animate SVG shapes.

After I had cut the entire illustration to get components, I had built my interaction. First though using device orientation properties, I decided to add some compatibility for unavailable gyroscope devices (using the mouse mouvement).

## What have I learnt ?

Well, not that much. But this was a realling interesting way of getting out of my usual "build usefull things, ignore useless ones" way of thinking.

So here is the lesson I got : useless things may provide satisfaction.
